API for Catora application

The documentation can be seen here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30042250/2s9YkoegsV

The API is built with expressjs for the main back-end service, flask for the main service of machine learning, and MySQL for the database. We deploy the API in a virtual machine because it is simple and clean, we use reverse proxy too.

This is our GitHub for development: https://github.com/Mikophi/Catora
